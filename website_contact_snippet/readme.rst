Contact Form Snippet
====================

Dynamic snippet to allow web forms on Odoo pages outside of the contact page. Easily create leads by positioning the snippet
at strategic positions on your website. Leads are collected just as you are used to in the backend.
Currently the snippet allows to add/remove preset fields that exist in the original contact form. For future development, we are
aiming to provide the possibility to add custom fields.
